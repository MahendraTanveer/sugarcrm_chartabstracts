This is a set of abstract classes that make it much easier to build chart dashlets in SugarCRM 6.2 or later.

To install, copy the abstract classes to the custom/include/Dashlets/ directory, then have the chart dashlet class you are building extend from one of these classes. Be sure to impliment whatever abstract methods are in the classes in your child class.
